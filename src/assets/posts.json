        "description": "DreamZzz is a game development project I started during my last year in highschool built with Godot and GDScript. I designed it to be a blending of two game genres I really enjoy: platformers and stealth games. During this project I learned a lot about UI design, pixel art, and game logic. Unfortunately, as I was approaching the end of my last year in high school, I found that I was not having as much fun working on DreamZzz as I would have wished so I decided to finish work on it once I was satisfied with the demo. To try out the game, you will have to download the Godot launcher, clone the repo, and run the game from within the engine.",
