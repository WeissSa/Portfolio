        "description": "<p>DreamZzz is a game development project I started during my last year in highschool built with Godot and GDScript. I designed it to be a blending of two game genres I really enjoy: platformers and stealth games. During this project I learned a lot about UI design, pixel art, and game logic. Unfortunately, as I was approaching the end of my last year in high school, I found that I was not having as much fun working on DreamZzz as I would have wished so I decided to finish work on it once I was satisfied with the demo. To try out the game, you will have to download the Godot launcher, clone the repo, and run the game from within the engine.</p>",

        "description": "<p>During the summer before I started university I was given the amazing opportunity to instruct Python to students ages 8-16 (although most fell within the range of 10-12). During this summer I also did some basic Micro:bit and Scratch instruction, but my focus was Python. The repo attached to this post is a collection of games I made using pygame to help teach coding to my students. They are all designed to be completed within a week and vary in complexity since as the summer went on I had some students who repeatedly kept taking my class and thus needed an extra optional challenge. This experience was extremely useful for strengthening my fundamental understanding of both Python, and how pygame renders visual data, which helped build the foundation for the Cryptocurrency graphing software I made for school and some of the work I did at Paper.</p>",

For this project we were tasked with analyzing the change in a trend due to COVID and displaying it creatively. I wanted to create a larger challenge for myself so I decided to stretch my pygame knowledge gained the previous summer and create a custom graphing framework using pygame. Upon running main.py, the project lets you choose 2 cryptocurrencies to compare + a metric and shows you how the two currencies developed in that metric over time. The repo's README has some reccomended comparisons. I learned a lot about UI development, object oriented programming, and how to nicely work with Excel from this project.</p>",

He was dyslexic, so this website had a focus on being accessible and using visual information. This was my first experience with web development and I explored using a variety of frameworks but I ended up using Flask (although I did some early experimentation with React as a frontend). I did this project as volunteer work on top of school so it happened over the course of a few months, but in the end it was positively received by my supervisor. The website handled help tickets and could filter through them by a variety of fields. Furthermore, it had a robust authentication system and a unique admin role who could manage other users. It was meant for both the submission and the management of tickets.</p>",

This was a part time volunteer position, but I got the opportunity to work as part of his SDS team to improve Markus. During this time I made a few large contributions on both the frontend and backend. Firstly, I added were the ability to create, update, destroy, edit and add/remove a tag from a group with an API call. Secondly, I changed the UI so that markdown/latex text could be previewed in a seperate tab (using React + MathJax). Finally, I added the ability for an instructor to distribute markers for an assignment in a random but non-uniform fashion. I also significantly improved the test coverage on the frontend with Jest. </p>",

During this time I learned so much about web development and good coding standards. I mainly worked with Vue.js and Jest, but I also did some work with PDF.js. I worked on optimizing the user experience for thousands of Tutors and Students. My most impactful contributions include (but are not limited to, partially due to an NDA): an automatic essay word counter for PDFs, essay comment saving for tutors on reload and helping an admin user detect inappropriate essay comments. In total, I wrote over 4.5k lines of code over my 15 week internship. I also built skills in code-reviewing my colleagues and working in an agile environment. </p>",
