          I'm a lover of the outdoors and have spent 8 Throughout myof my
          summers going to summer camp in the beautiful Algonquin Park (of which
          one I was a counselor in training and 7 a camper). I particularly
          enjoy being in the wilderness and hiking around the park.
          <br />
          I went to high school at the University of Toronto Schools and
          participated in a variety of activities including their Classics
          organization. During this time I learned 3 years of Latin as part of
          school, and basic Ancient Greek extracurricularly. I participated in
          the Ontario School Classics Conference and won awards in Junior Greek
          Derivatives (1st) Junior Greek Sight Translation (2nd) and Junior Oral
          Mythology (2nd). Since I have always had a passion for Classical
          History, this shaped my high school experience and for a while I even
          wanted to study Classics at Oxford! However, in my grade 10 year I
          took my first Computer Science class and became enamoured!
          <br />
          After applying to university, I ended up deciding to go to the
          University of Toronto and am currently in the middle of specializing
          in Computer Science and minoring in Math. As I am still early in my
          career, I am not quite sure where I went to end up in this field, but
          I have a feeling I would enjoy working with AI or on software
          development (although currently a majority of my experience lies in
          game development and web development).
          <br />
          In the end, I am just excited to keep exploring life, nature, and the
          amazing field of Computer Science.
